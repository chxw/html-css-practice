`resume.html` - Your resume. Real or fictitious. 
1. Full name or handle
2. Education
3. Relevant Coursework
4. Professional Experience.
5. Skills.
6. Activities that are related to your field of study or work.

`bio.html` - A short biography of yourself. Real or fictitious. 

`index.html` - Personal home page. 
1. Your name.
2. Photo of you.
3. Link to resume
4. Link to short biography.

## Files:
TBD

SVG icons are from themify (their CSS stylesheet was NOT used in this). Retrieved from [https://themify.me/themify-icons](https://themify.me/themify-icons).

## Reflection:
Respect to whoever is really good at CSS. I spent 6 hours on this, and the page still feels pretty ugly.
